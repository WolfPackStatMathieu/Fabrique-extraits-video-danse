SPEAKER_08:  And we are live. Hello dear tango experts. Hello, Mario Daniel saying welcome to this new session of. I want to let me let you talk more. That's why I do this. 

So today we are going to do the second session of tangovals. Of this time, of course, because we have been doing tangovals in other occasions but. This time we were asked to do tangovals as we explained you last time. Tangovals is something that we actually don't teach anymore because we don't find really the. Sense of doing it because the steps are exactly the same. So that's why I say it is not that we don't teach. tangovals, but we teach tango and then the application on tangovals, which is actually I think the correct. The correct method of teaching tangovals because. Regarding some questions that there were about tangovals there are no tangovals figures. There are figures tango figures that are very good for tangovals because of this turning dynamic, but there are no. Figures exclusively for tango values. It's important to know that. So that's the reason why we do for example, milonga workshops. Yes, we do it milonga workshop. So we do milonga workshops because milonga is a is a different dance. But we don't do exclusively tangovals workshops, but we do tango classes and then application to tangovals because dancing is exactly the same. There, there, there's another rhythm, another double timing. There's another dynamic. There are no pauses and things like this. But according to figures, it's actually exactly the same that tango. Now answering to some questions. One question actually. Are there any figures from tango that we don't do in tangovals? My answer to this is. If you're talking about tango milongero tango salon. There are no figures that are not possible to do in tangovals or are not good in tangovals. All figures of tango milongero and tango salon are good for tangovals too. Now if we talk about tango scenario, which is this performing time with lifting figures and many things very theatrally things performing poses and so on. Of course, there are many things I don't prefer from tangovals, but talking about improvisation tango. Everything what you can do in tango, you can do it in tangovals, but you must use the right application regarding to the rhythm, to the double timing, to the dynamic, especially turning dynamics. It doesn't have to be, but tangovals has something of turning circular dynamics. For example, let's say, very, very basic example. If you are doing something like this in tango. Dr. Khatro Sinko, Khatro Sinko. If you are doing, for example, this is tango. This is not going to be good for tangovals because it has no dynamic. So, this kind of things, but I think this is logical. This is obvious. So I don't have to say that. But of course, all these slow movements and wide expression movements, they are not for tangovals. It must be happening something all the time. 

4:00
So, after this, let's go to the instructions of the lesson, which is going to be the same as always for the new people. The right foot is going to be the white shoe, the left foot is going to be the black shoe. So you know always which foot I am walking with. And if it is parallel or cross system. Second, if you have any questions, you can write your questions in the chat, or you can activate your microphone and just talk. Third, if you want to turn on your camera and show us life what we're doing, but no, what you are doing, we can give you life feedback. You always have this possibility. Fourth, if you have no time to watch the full lesson until the end. Move the video on to the last 15 minutes of this lesson, and you are going to find a review, a general review of everything what we did during the lesson, of course, for more details, you have to watch everything because just 15 minutes, but then you can get an idea of what we did in the lesson. Number five, if you want to improve more, and you would like to have feedback only to you. You always have the possibility to record yourself dancing and send us your videos during the week so that we can make a video back for you, giving you feedback about your dancing as a tango expert member, you always have this possibility open. There are no extra costs, you can just do it, send us the video, and we are going to give you life, not life, but feedback only to you so we will send you a video back and no one is going to see this. This is only for you between us. Then I noted that in the last lesson in the last time of our lesson. In the review, I forgot to change the microphone, and I was with the camera microphone here so it's not very good to hear. Please, tangatoes, if this happens and you know that sent me a message in the chat because every time that I do this, I am looking if there is some message in the chat so you can just type there, hey, your microphone is not working or whatever. I will switch it because I normally don't forget it but this time I just forgot it and exactly the review so if you know it just type it there and I will switch it fast so now. 


We want to start with the second part of this Tangovals series which is going to be a giro in a cadine like a turn in cadena as a chain. We call it cadena because you know the official cadena in tango is this figure here that I assume you all know this figure which is called cadena, the cadena is very good. But it could be dangerous at Milon. So that's why we use the concept of the cadena as a chain for doing sequences that you can repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat and they connect with each other so that there's no. You can just dance and dance and dance and dance and repeat the same sequence and there are steps that help to connect the sequence, the end of the sequence with the beginning of the sequence so that you can repeat the sequence all the time. And this is what we are going to do today, especially folks focus on the giro. I recommend you to not think about the giro like this with this and Rosquez and embellishments and whatever the man makes in the giro. Take it more easy, because for doing this kind of giroes I know there are many people trying to do this kind of things here. Like many embellishments and things that they cannot really do because the leader needs a lot of technique for that. And the lady needs to know how to make the giro so it's quite difficult. But if you do giroes with contra giroes, then it's easier to create different variants. And you can make it clear.

DEFINITION GIRO AND CONTRA GIRO
 What is a giro, the giro is what the woman makes around the man, which is back side forward, forward back side forward back and so on. It's all the time the same. It's easier to say back side forward forward, some people say back side forward side, it depends. It's exactly the same. The contra giro is what the man makes as an answer to the woman's giro. And for example, if I do this kind of steps here, what I am doing now is a contra giro, because my steps are not exactly the giro what she's doing, but I am doing some variations at the same time. And the whole version of this dance is called contra giro and what she's doing is giro. The giro is always the same, it never changes. The contra giro depends, you can create a new contra giro every time that you dance. And what you do now is that we are going to work with this giro with a contra giro without the necessity of doing this kind of things. This is more for very advanced. So don't worry about it. We can do special workshops about it. But for dancing and belonging, you don't need it. You actually don't need this kind of and Rosquez and things that you see on performances, you need contra giroes. 


So, today, we're going to work on giro and contra giro with a connection to both sides, so that you can connect the end of the sequence with the beginning of the sequence to one side or to the other. And the first thing we are going to do to prepare it is backward ochos, nothing else backward ochos. And then I go back on the three, that's it. We go into the sequence with a salida change of weight, backward ochos, and then I go to the three. Now from this other point of view.

BAckward ochos 11:28,11:35

 Side step, backward ochos. Side step, backward ochos. And three, it's important to take into account that when you go out on the three, it's on the right side of the man. And then I go out with the left foot forward and the woman with the left foot backward.
SPEAKER_06:  Very normal, it's very, every back ochos resolving on the three. So, let's do it. So, let's do it.
SPEAKER_05:  So, let's do it.
SPEAKER_06:  So, let's do it.

14:53
SPEAKER_08:  Let's continue. So now, we just did this at the beginning so that you know where we are going to be working from. All figures that you do, it doesn't matter how difficult the figure or the sequence is, they start all from some basic movement or basic figures. So it's important for you to know where is it starting from. And what we're going to do is starting from the cross system. So, there's no better example for the cross system or for going into the cross system than back ochos because you don't think about it, they're just doing, and you are in middle in cross system. But that's what we want now. We did back ochos because of two reasons. The first one is a very direct entrance into the cross system because you change automatically here. And because we are going out from the back ochos on the three, which is here with my left foot forward and her left foot back. And from this three, we are going to connect what we're going to do now. 

next step,16:28,16:40
So the next step, I want to do it step by step without many difficult things. The next step is a second. We go out on the three. And now I go with the right foot inside to us. From this color, we continue doing back ochos so this is just to prepare what we're going to do with the hill after. Side step, three back ochos. I go to the three to go out of the ochos. Then I go with the right foot inside. I do a second and we do back ochos again, where you can actually repeat the same second with the same ochos. So then we are one step ahead. And step back ochos. Three, Sakaada. Back ochos again, three, Sakaada. And so on. 

17:37 It's important also to note that the Sakaada and I want to show it from this point of view. Take a look. The Sakaada is behind her foot. If I exaggerate, it would be like here, you know, behind the foot. The mistake that many people do is that they try to do the Sakaada directly to the foot and they find no space here. Because they want to do the Sakaada like this, but it doesn't work like this. So the Sakaada goes behind the foot, behind the heel. This is the three. And then I go behind the heel. Here's the Sakaada. So then we can say that the Sakaada is not happening from the foot or because of the foot. Sakaada is happening because of the leg because my leg is pushing her leg. My leg is pushing her leg. And that's why the Sakaada happens. ochos back work. I place my foot. And then when I change the way is my leg, which is pushing to her neck. And then we go back to the ochos back work. Let's do it from four different points of view.

advice for leader: cross with toes, the heel remains up.
keep the contact with the right hand, and with the left hand
in open embrace the contact of the sacada is under the knee
in close embrace, the contact is going to be over the knee.
cross a little bit back, with the heel up
